    A good API is like a fine restaurant â€“ it serves exactly what you crave, right away!

    Just like a top-notch restaurant, developing and maintaining an API requires a lot of effort. Understanding client needs is as crucial as knowing the available ingredients.

    In the past, we had to write extensive code to send, receive, parse, and generate data, often in XML or EDI formats. I vividly recall writing a plethora of code, only to learn one November day in 2007 that XElement could easily replace it all! Just as the flexible XML DOM made rigid EDI formats obsolete, JSON significantly reduced package sizes.

    Today, developers often prioritize API interoperability, security, and documentation.

    I appreciate Azure Service Fabric services because they simplify scaling your business logic in step with your business growth.
