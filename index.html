        <p>It wasn't long ago that a great way to send data to someone was to attach a small note to the leg
          to a carrier pigeon. Fortunately, these days, we don’t need to employ millions of pigeons in order to sync
          tables between two database systems. Now all those pigeons are free to retire to their big city havens to snag
          tasty morsels from unsuspecting pedestrians. </p>

        <h3>System to system integration</h3>
        <p>Moving data between systems isn't easy. You need a good server, a sensible Web API, and perhaps
          some HangFire jobs or SQL Server Integration Services jobs running in the background. Carrier
          pigeons not included.</p>

        <p>I usually work with windows based servers. IIS can be tricky to configure, but it's pretty effective.
          Azure web servers are the way to go.</p>

      <div id="apis" class="baseball-card">
        <p>I like Azure Service Fabric services because they make it easy to scale your business logic in step
          with scaling your business.</p>

        <h3>Software development</h3>
        <p>Modern software development is both an art, and a badge of determination. Just because the end user
          doesn't see the code doesn't mean it can be ugly. There is a fine balance between development velocity,
          syntactic elegance, and highly performant code.</p>
