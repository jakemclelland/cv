      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">It wasn't long ago that a great way to send data to someone was to attach a small note to the leg 
        to a carrier pigeon. Fortunately, these days, we don’t need to employ millions of pigeons in order to sync a 
        single table between two database systems. Now all those pigeons are free to retire to their big city 
        havens to snag tasty morsels from unsuspecting pedestrians. </p>

        <h3>System to system integration</h3>
        <p>Moving data between systems isn't easy. You need a good server, a sensible Web API, and perhaps 
          some HangFire jobs or SQL Server Integration Services jobs running in the background. Carrier 
          pigeons not included.</p>

      <div id="servers" class="baseball-card">
        <p>I usually work with windows based servers. IIS can be tricky to configure, but it's pretty effective. 
          Azure web servers are the way to go.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="apis" class="baseball-card">
        <p>I like Azure Service Fabric services because they make it easy to scale your business logic in step 
          with scaling your business.</p>

        <h3>Software development</h3>
        <p>Modern software development is both an art, and a badge of determination. Just because the end user 
          doesn't see the code doesn't mean it can be ugly. There is a fine balance between development velocity, 
          syntactic elegance, and highly performant code.</p>
